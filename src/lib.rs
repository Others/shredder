//! shredder
//! ========
//! `shredder` is a library providing a garbage collected smart pointer: `Gc`.
//! This is useful for times when you want shared access to some data, but the structure
//! of the data has unpredictable cycles in it. (So Arc would not be appropriate.)
//!
//! `shredder` has the following features:
//! - safe: detects error conditions on the fly, and protects you from undefined behavior
//! - ergonomic: no need to manually manage roots, just a regular smart pointer
//! - ready for fearless concurrency: works in multi-threaded contexts
//! - limited stop-the world: regular processing will rarely be interrupted
//! - seamless destruction: regular `drop` for `'static` data
//! - clean finalization: optional `finalize` for non-`'static` data
//! - concurrent collection: collection happens in the background, improving performance
//! - concurrent destruction: destructors are run in the background, improving performance
//!
//! `shredder` has the following limitations:
//! - guarded access: accessing `Gc` data requires acquiring a guard
//! - multiple collectors: only a single global collector is supported
//! - can't handle `Rc`/`Arc`: requires all `Gc` objects have straightforward ownership semantics
//! - further parallelization: The collector needs to be optimized and parallelized further (will fix!)
//! - no no-std support: The collector requires threading and other `std` features (will fix!)
