/// A trait capturing the ability of data to be scanned for references to data in a `Gc`.
///
/// This is unsafe, since a bad `scan` implementation can cause memory unsafety in two ways:
/// 1) If `scan` scans data that this object does not own
/// 2) If `scan` does anything other than `scan` data with a non-`'static` lifetime
///
/// The importance of (1) is so that the collector does not collect data that is in use. The
/// importance of (2) is so that this data can still be scanned even after its lifetime has
/// technically expired.
///
/// Regarding (1): Note that it's okay to miss data that you own. Missing connected data can only
/// cause memory leaks--not memory unsafety.
/// Regarding (2): In particular, `scan` should not call anything but `Scan` on `R` and `RMut`. Even
/// implicitly using the `deref` implementations on these structs is incorrect.
///
/// Importantly, any empty `scan` implementation is safe (assuming the `GcSafe` impl is correct)
///
/// NB: It's important that `scan` only scans data that is truly owned. `Rc`/`Arc` cannot have
/// sensible `scan` implementations, since each individual smart pointer doesn't own the underlying
/// data.
///
/// # Examples
/// In practice you probably want to use the derive macro:
/// ```
/// use shredder::Scan;
///
/// #[derive(Scan)]
/// struct Example {
///     v: u32
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This also comes with a `#[shredder(skip)]` attribute, for when some data implements `GcSafe` but
/// not `Scan`
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use shredder::Scan;
///
/// #[derive(Scan)]
/// struct Example {
///     #[shredder(skip)]
///     v: Arc<u32>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This can work for any `Send` data using `GcSafeWrapper`
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use shredder::{Scan, GcSafeWrapper};
///
/// struct SendDataButNotScan {
///     i: u32
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Scan)]
/// struct Example {
///     #[shredder(skip)]
///     v: GcSafeWrapper<SendDataButNotScan>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In emergencies, you can break out `#[shredder(unsafe_skip)]`, but this is potentially unsafe
/// (the field you're skipping MUST uphold invariants as-if it was `GcSafe`)
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use shredder::{Scan, GcSafeWrapper};

///     data: *mut u32
